        <h1>RE: Eileen Dover university applicatio</h1>

        <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
        
        <br>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part <br> of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</br></p>

        <h2>Starting dates</h2>
        
        <br>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you <br> could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</br></p>

        <ul>
            <li>. First semesrer: 9 September 2019</li>
            
            <li>. Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>

            <li>. Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
        </ul>

        <P>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</P>

        <p>You can find more information about<U> important university dates</u> on our website.</p>

        <h3>Subjects of study</h3>

        <br>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall <br> somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just  <br> the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued  <br> by are as follows, in order of priority:</br> </p> 

        <ul>
            <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)</li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the<br>  audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 *10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 *1o<sup>4</sup></br></li>
            <li><abbr title="HyperText MarkUp Language">HTML</abbr> and "CSS" constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>

        <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, <br> my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</br></p>
        
         <section>
            <di>
                <di>Polynesian chicken dance</di>                
                <dd> little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around <br> in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</br></dd>
                <di>Icelandic brownian shuffle</di>
                <dd> Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which  <br>involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly  <br> tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired <br> modern styles such as Twerking.</br></dd>
                <di>Arctic robot dance</di>
               <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have <br> discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by <br>  inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this <br> because they were really cold.</br></dd>
         </section>

        <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
